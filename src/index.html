                The rise and fall of The Broken Bistro is a story of neglect and decay. Once a popular spot, now it’s just a forgotten corner, left to the elements and time.

                The Broken Bistro is not for the faint of heart. Visit if you must, but beware – there’s nothing appetizing left to find here.
